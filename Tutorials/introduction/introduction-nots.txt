Producer
 - Sends messages to queue

Queue
 - A queue is messages order inside RabbitMQ
 - A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer
 - Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue.

Consumer
 - A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages

NOTE
 - Producer, consumer and broker dont have to reside on the same host
 - An application can be both a producer and consumer
